<h3>Iteration</h3>

This is a simple exercise to practice iterations using for, while and do while loops.

Objective:

Iterate and display numbers using for, while and do while loops.
    
       /* 
        for Loop exercise
        */
        for(int h = 100; h >= 0; h-=20){
            System.out.print(h +"\n");
        }
        
         /* 
        while Loop exercise
        */
        System.out.println("\nWhile loop");
        int i = 0;
        while(i < 16){
            System.out.println(i);
        i++;
        }
        
         /* 
        do while Loop exercise
        */
        System.out.println("\nDo While loop");
        int j = 10;
        do{
            System.out.println(j);
            j++;
        } 
        while(j < 20);
        
<h3> Selection </h3>

This is a simple exercise to practice selection statements. 

Objective:

Using if, else if and else statements to check and execute an action if the condition is true or not. 

        if(cdNum >= 10 && cdNum <=19){
            discount = 20;
        }
        else if(cdNum >=20 && cdNum <=39){
            discount = 30;
        }
        else if(cdNum >=40){
            discount = 50;
        }
        else {
            discount = 0;
        }
